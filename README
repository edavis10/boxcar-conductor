==============

This plugin provides you with deployment tools for your Rails application,
which will help you deploy to your RailsBoxcar.com instance.

before you begin:

## Automatic Installation ##

If you're running a recent version of Rails, you can just install the
plugin directly by doing:

## Manual Installation ##

Otherwise, you can just do a manual install by following these steps:

0.9) If you have git installed on your machine, just go into your
    vendor/plugins directory and do
    
git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/boxcar-conductor.git

    And then skip to step 3. Otherwise...

1) Download a tarball of the latest release from

http://github.com/robbyrussell/boxcar-conductor/tarball/master

2) Untar this into your vendor/plugins directory, and rename the resulting
   folder to boxcar-conductor

3) cd into the boxcar-conductor directory, and do:

../../../script/runner install.rb
